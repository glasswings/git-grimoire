# Glasswings' Git Grimoire

This is my collection of notes for how to understand and use git. It's inspired
by my frustration at beginner resources, which often seem to foster a cookbook
mentality. If you want to do X, type in these commands. If they don't work,
you're screwed and need to get help from the git wizard on your team. If you
don't have a git wizard, oh boy. 

My goal is to become the git wizard. Eventually. This book is written as if it
were the textbook I need to reach that goal. This isn't because I am right about
things; rather, because I enjoy the clarity of didactic writing. So naturally it
comes with a few caveats:

 - I am wrong sometimes
 - I am *certainly* wrong about the specifics of your team and its workflow.

The thing that would help me most at my current stage, more than text, would be
hearing your war-stories about being a git newbie or working with them, your
misconceptions, things that scare you, and just generally events in which
someone *didn't know enough* and needed to be bailed out. So I'm more interested
in issues than pull reports. For now. 

Please feel free to fork though, that's what the BY-SA license is for. :)

## TODO
 - evaluate whether jekyll meets my needs as a static site generator
 - draft chapter: git is an editor for patch sets, basic navigation
